        "Where little, mushroom-eating, weed-smoking hobbits manage, while probably high as fuck, to deal with problems the armies of man couldn't do shit about. A literal brick of excessive details, fantasy and adventure, sprinkled with old-timer misogyny. Nice maps and artworks in some editions tho.",

When you're done, go browse the web for linked concepts and ideas, and become a guerilla gardener, or just punch nazis. You should probably learn sabotage, electronics, how to cook vegan meals, and punch people in the face.",
