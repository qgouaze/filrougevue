        <p>Libraries are the best thing since kibbles. Online libraries, free libraries, pirate libraries are the usual variations, but we thought a peer-to-peer library was missing. Don't just use your books as scratch-posts, lend them to other people (or cats)! Or you can be greedy and borrow books from everyone, building yourself the ultimate booknook/labyrinth from whence you shall not ever come out, only for sustenance. And pet the cats.</p>
